Resources allow you to securely connect your internal tools to your infrastructure (databases, APIs, etc.).

## Organization-Level Resources

You can define resources at the organization level. Once configured, these resources become available for use by **any application** in your organization.

### Managing Resources
1. Navigate to **Organization Settings > Resources**.
2. Click **Add Resource** and select the type (Postgres, REST API, etc.).
3. Configure the connection details and credentials.

<Note>
Resource credentials are encrypted and never exposed to the client-side application code.
</Note>

### Using Resources
In the App Editor, you can bind these pre-configured resources to your application. The platform handles the secure connection and authentication automatically.

To interact with these resources in your code, use the [`@major-tech/resource-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@major-tech/resource-client) library. It provides a simple, secure interface to query your connected infrastructure.
