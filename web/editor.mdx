The Major Editor provides a collaborative environment to modify your applications and manage deployments.

## Live Editor

You can edit any application via a live editing session in the browser. Changes are reflected instantly in the preview pane.

### AI Assistance
The editor includes an AI assistant that has full context of your application code. You can ask it to:
- Explain complex logic
- Refactor components
- Implement new features directly in the codebase

### Real-time Preview
Every editing session includes a live preview of the application's latest version, allowing you to verify changes immediately before deploying.

## Version Control & Deployment

Major integrates with GitHub to version control your applications.

### Version History
You can view a complete history of your application's versions. Each version is linked to a commit, ensuring full traceability of changes.

### One-Click Deploy
Deploying to production is instant. Navigate to the version you want to ship and click **Deploy**. The new version becomes available to all users with access immediately.
