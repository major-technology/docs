Major provides a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to secure your internal tools.

## Application Permissions

You can manage permissions on a per-application basis. The creator of an app automatically receives **Owner** permissions.

### Available Roles

- **Owner**: Full control, including deleting the app and managing permissions.
- **Edit**: Can modify the app in the editor and create new versions.
- **View**: Can run and use the deployed application.

### Sharing Access
You can share access to your application with specific:
- **Individuals**: Invite users by email.
- **Groups**: Grant access to entire teams at once.

## Groups

Groups allow you to manage permissions for sets of users efficiently.

- **Inheritance**: All members of a group inherit the permissions granted to the group.
- **Default Permissions**: Groups can be configured to have default permissions (e.g., View) on all new apps created in the organization.

### All Users Group
Every organization includes a special **All Users** group containing every member of the organization.
- By default, this group is set to have **View** permissions on every new app, making internal tools open-by-default within the company.
- You can modify this setting if you prefer a more restrictive default.

## Organization Settings

Admins can configure organization-wide access policies.

### Domain Access
In the organization settings, you can configure the application to automatically grant access to any user signing in with a matching company email domain (e.g., `@yourcompany.com`).
