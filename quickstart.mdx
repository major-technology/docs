title: "Quickstart"
description: "Install the Major CLI, connect your org, and deploy your first internal tool."
---

This walkthrough mirrors the structure of the Claude Code quickstart so the flow feels familiar while staying specific to Major. 🚀

## Prerequisites

- macOS or Linux with Git installed.
- Node.js **22.12+** and **pnpm** (the `major app` commands enforce these versions automatically).
- Access to a Major organization (you’ll pick it during login).

<Tip icon="key">
If you plan to connect databases or APIs, make sure you already have those resources registered in the Major App Editor so you can attach them during app creation.
</Tip>

## Step 1 — Install the CLI

Choose the path that matches how you manage tooling:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Homebrew" icon="beer-mug-empty">
    ```bash
    brew install major-technology/major/major
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Install script (curl)" icon="code">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/major-technology/cli/main/install.sh | bash
    ```
  </Card>
</Columns>

Both options place the `major` binary on your PATH. Confirm with `major --version`.

## Step 2 — Authenticate and set your org

```bash
major user login
```

- We launch a device-code flow in your browser so you can use SSO.
- After you approve the login, the CLI stores a short-lived token plus refresh info in your keychain.
- You’ll be prompted to select a **default organization** (`major org select` can change it later).

<Note>
`major user whoami` verifies your session and shows the org that scoped env variables and deployments will use.
</Note>

## Step 3 — Create or clone an application

Pick whichever best matches your workflow:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create from a template" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    ```bash
    major app create
    ```
    
    - Choose a template (Vite is the default).
    - Major provisions a GitHub repo, wires up the template, and invites you as a collaborator (we’ll prompt for your GitHub username if it isn’t cached from `major git config`).
    - Select the resources (databases, APIs) the app should reach. We store the mapping for deployments and local dev.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clone an existing app" icon="clone">
    ```bash
    major app clone
    ```
    
    - Choose from your organization’s applications.
    - We clone (or pull) the repo, invite you if needed, and regenerate `.env` + `RESOURCES.md` so you’re ready to run.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 4 — Run locally

```bash
major app start
```

This command:

- Calls the Major API to mint a new JWT and writes every required variable into `.env`.
- Runs `pnpm install` to keep dependencies in sync with the template baseline.
- Starts `pnpm dev` so your local server proxies requests through the Major control plane.

You can view or edit the app from the UI anytime with:

```bash
major app editor
```

## Step 5 — Deploy

```bash
major app deploy
```

Major will:

1. Ensure you’re inside a Git repository that matches a known application.
2. Prompt for a commit message if it sees unstaged work, then stage/commit/push for you.
3. Create a new version through the API and stream deployment status (bundling → building → deploying).
4. Print the production URL when the status flips to `DEPLOYED`.

<Callout icon="sparkles">
Treat deployments as cheap. You can redeploy as often as you’d push to GitHub—Major reuses the same resources and RBAC policies, so there’s nothing else to configure.
</Callout>
