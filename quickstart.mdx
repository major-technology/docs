## Prerequisites

- macOS or Linux with Git installed.
- Node.js **22.12+** and **pnpm** (the `major app` commands enforce these versions automatically).

<Tip icon="key">
If you plan to connect databases or APIs, make sure you already have those resources registered in https://app.major.build so you can attach them during app creation.
</Tip>

## Step 1 — Install the CLI

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash curl (Recommended)
  curl -fsSL https://install.major.build | bash
  ```

  ```bash Homebrew
  brew tap major-technology/tap
  brew install major-technology/tap/major
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Confirm with `major --version`.

## Step 2 — Authenticate and set your org

```bash
major user login
```

<Note>
`major user whoami` verifies your session and shows the org that scoped env variables and deployments will use.
</Note>

## Step 3 — Create or clone an application

Pick whichever best matches your workflow:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create from a template" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    ```bash
    major app create
    ```
    
    - Choose a template (Vite is the default).
    - Major provisions a GitHub repo, wires up the template, and invites you as a collaborator.
    - Select the resources (databases, APIs) the app should reach. We store the mapping for deployments and local dev.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clone an existing app" icon="clone">
    ```bash
    major app clone
    ```
    
    - Choose from your organization’s applications.
    - We clone (or pull) the repo, invite you if needed, and regenerate `.env` + your resource clients so that you're ready to run.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 4 — Run locally

```bash
major app start
```

This command:

- Calls the Major API to mint a new JWT and writes every required variable into `.env`.
- Runs `pnpm install` to keep dependencies in sync with the template baseline.
- Starts `pnpm dev` so your local server proxies requests through the Major control plane.

You can view or edit the app from the UI anytime with:

```bash
major app editor
```

## Step 5 — Configure Resources

Configure the resources you want your app to interact with.

```bash
major resource create
```

<Tip>
  We highly recommend reading [Resource connections](/workflows/resource-connections) to understand how resource connections work.
</Tip>

## Step 6 — Deploy

```bash
major app deploy
```

Major will:

1. Prompt for a commit message if it sees unstaged work, then stage/commit/push for you.
2. Create a new version through the API and stream deployment status (bundling → building → deploying).
3. Print the production URL when the status flips to `DEPLOYED`.
