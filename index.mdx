description: "Deploy, secure, and manage every internal tool you build with the Major CLI."
---

Major lets you deploy internal tools directly from your laptop while keeping access governed in one place. Engineers who build internal apps use the CLI to:

1. **Deploy code instantly** – scaffold apps from templates, push with a single command, and ship a new version in seconds.
2. **Manage access & permissions** – assign roles in the web editor and ensure every action respects RBAC.
3. **Connect to internal resources securely** – route database and API traffic through the Major control plane instead of punching new holes in your network.

Local traffic always flows `local app → Major API → resource`. When you run `major app start`, we mint a short-lived JWT in your `.env` file so every request is authenticated through the platform.
