title: "major git"
description: "Keep your GitHub identity in sync so repo invites work without friction."

There is currently one subcommand in this group, but it unlocks a smoother experience whenever the CLI has to create or clone repositories on your behalf.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `major git config` | Store (or update) the GitHub username Major should invite to repos. |

## `major git config`

```bash
major git config
```

- Reads any username already stored in your keychain and shows it as the default.
- Prompts for a new username (validation requires a non-empty string).
- Saves the username securely so future commands can reuse it.

The CLI uses this value when:

- `major app create` provisions a fresh repo and needs to add you as a collaborator.
- `major app clone` encounters a permissions error while pulling an existing repo.

Keeping the username current means the CLI can automatically invite you and poll until GitHub grants access, which prevents confusing `permission denied` errors during critical workflows.
