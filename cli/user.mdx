title: "major user"
description: "Authenticate to Major, manage your session, and inspect who you are logged in as."
---

The `user` group handles authentication. Tokens are stored in your OS keychain, never in plaintext files.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `major user login` | Start the device-code flow, store your CLI token, and pick a default org. |
| `major user logout` | Revoke the token server-side and delete it locally. |
| `major user whoami` | Verify which account and org the CLI will use. |

## `major user login`

```bash
major user login
```

- Opens the Major SSO approval page in your browser. If the browser fails, the CLI prints the URL so you can copy it elsewhere.
- Polls the API until the code is approved, then stores the resulting token in the keychain.
- Fetches the organizations you belong to and lets you pick a default one (stored locally so future commands inherit it).
- Prints next steps (`major app clone` / `major app create`).

<Note>
You can re-run `login` anytime. The CLI will simply refresh the token and prompt for an org again.
</Note>

## `major user logout`

```bash
major user logout
```

- Calls the API to revoke your session.
- Removes the token and default-organization metadata from the keychain.
- Does **not** delete your local repos; it just severs authentication.

Run this before you hand a laptop to someone else or if you need to switch accounts entirely.

## `major user whoami`

```bash
major user whoami
```

- Calls `/verify` on the API with your stored token.
- Prints your email and the default org name + ID (if one is set).

Use it when debugging permission issues or confirming that `major org select` actually updated your context.
