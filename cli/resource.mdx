title: "major resource"
description: "Manage resource attachments from your terminal."
---

Use the `resource` group when you need to add or edit the databases/APIs an app can touch.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `major resource create` | Open the App Editor directly on the "Add resource" screen. |
| `major resource manage` | Attach/detach resources for the current app and sync local files. |

## `major resource create`

```bash
major resource create
```

- Looks up the CLI config’s `frontend_uri` and opens `<frontend_uri>/resources?action=add` in your browser.
- Use it when you already know a new resource needs to exist but you’re not yet ready to attach it to an app.

## `major resource manage`

```bash
major resource manage
```

**Prereqs:** logged in, default org selected, and run from inside an app repo.

**Flow:**

1. The CLI determines your application ID (via the git remote) and fetches its current resource bindings.
2. You select which resources to attach using an interactive menu.
3. After the API updates succeed, the CLI:
   - Updates Vite projects via the Major client helper **or**
   - Regenerates `RESOURCES.md` for frameworks like Next.js.
4. Old files are deleted automatically so your repo only shows the latest configuration.

Run this whenever:

- Security granted the app new scopes.
- You removed a resource in the editor and need to reflect that locally.
- A teammate added resources while you were heads-down and you want your environment to match theirs.
