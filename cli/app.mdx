title: "major app"
description: "Create, run, and deploy applications with the Major CLI."
---

`major app` is the largest command group in the CLI. It assumes you have Node **22.12+**, pnpm, and Git installed—the command enforces these prerequisites before it runs.

| Subcommand | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `major app create` | Scaffold a new app + repo from a template and attach resources. |
| `major app clone` | Pull an existing org app and sync env files/resources. |
| `major app start` | Install deps, mint a JWT, and launch the dev server. |
| `major app deploy` | Commit/push changes, create a new version, and stream deployment status. |
| `major app info` | Print the application ID for the repo you’re in. |
| `major app editor` | Open the App Editor for the current app. |

<Callout icon="circle-info">
Every subcommand figures out the current application by looking at your git remote. Make sure `origin` points to the Major-managed repo before you run them.
</Callout>

## `major app create`

```bash
major app create
```

**When to use:** starting a brand-new internal tool.

**What happens:**

1. Prompts for application name + description.
2. Fetches templates from the Major API (Vite is prioritized) and lets you pick one.
3. Calls `POST /applications` to create the app + GitHub repo, then swaps the template into that repo.
4. Ensures you have repo access (invites you via GitHub if necessary and walks you through accepting it).
5. Lets you select internal resources to attach; writes them into the platform immediately.
6. Pushes the initialized code, moves it into `./<app-name>`, generates `.env`, and prints next steps (`start`, `deploy`, `editor`).

<Note>
Configure `major git config` ahead of time so we already know your GitHub username when it’s time to invite you to the repo.
</Note>

## `major app clone`

```bash
major app clone
```

**When to use:** onboarding to an existing app or refreshing a stale local copy.

**What happens:**

- Lists every application inside your default organization and lets you pick one.
- Determines a destination folder based on the app name (falls back to the GitHub repo name if a folder already exists).
- Clones the repo (or `git pull`s if it’s already there) using SSH when possible, HTTPS otherwise.
- Automatically invites you to the GitHub repo if access fails and retries until it succeeds.
- Regenerates `.env` and `RESOURCES.md` (or updates the Vite helper) so your local environment matches prod.

## `major app start`

```bash
major app start
```

**When to use:** any time you need a clean local environment or a fresh JWT.

**What happens:**

1. Calls the API for the latest environment variables, including a short-lived JWT that proxies requests through Major.
2. Writes everything into `.env` in the repo root.
3. Runs `pnpm install` and then `pnpm dev`, piping stdout/stderr to your terminal.

If you fail Node/pnpm requirements the command tells you what to install before retrying.

## `major app deploy`

```bash
major app deploy
```

**When to use:** shipping any change to production.

**What happens:**

1. Verifies you’re in a git repo that belongs to a known application.
2. Checks for uncommitted work. If found, it prompts for a commit message, stages everything, commits, and pushes to `main` for you.
3. Grabs the default organization from your keychain.
4. Calls `POST /applications/{id}/versions` and starts polling deployment status (`BUNDLING → BUILDING → DEPLOYING → DEPLOYED`).
5. Streams a spinner + status messages via Bubble Tea. When the deployment finishes, it prints the live URL.

If the status ends in `*_FAILED`, we print the error payload from the API so you can debug quickly.

## `major app info`

```bash
major app info
```

Returns the application ID for the repo you are currently in. Helpful when you’re wiring automation or referencing the ID in scripts.

## `major app editor`

```bash
major app editor
```

Opens `https://app.major.build/apps/<application-id>/edit` in your default browser (based on whatever `frontend_uri` your CLI config points at). Use it to:

- Manage access (RBAC) for the app.
- Configure environments, resources, and reviewers.
- Preview UI changes through the web experience.

If the browser fails to open automatically, the CLI prints the URL so you can copy it manually.
