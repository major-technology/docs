```bash
major update
```

This command figures out how you installed the CLI and upgrades it in-place.

## What it detects

- **Homebrew installs** – If `brew list major` succeeds, we run `brew update && brew upgrade major`.
- **Direct installs** – Otherwise we pipe the official install script (`curl -fsSL ... | bash`).

The command prints styled status messages so you always know which path ran and whether anything changed.

## Best practices

- Run `major update` after upgrading Node or pnpm to make sure the CLI’s version check logic is up to date.
- Use it in CI agents too; it’s safe to run multiple times because the script exits early if the installed version already matches the latest release.
- After updating, run `major --version` to confirm.
