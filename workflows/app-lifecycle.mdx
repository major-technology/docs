<Steps>
  <Step title="Authenticate & pick an org">
    Run `major user login` to authenticate into your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create or clone the app">
    - `major app create` scaffolds from templates, provisions a GitHub repo, attaches resources, and generates your first `.env`.
    - `major app clone` to clone into any existing application in your org.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate locally">
    - Use `major app start` to install deps, mint a JWT, and boot `pnpm dev`.
    - Edit code/UI as usual; requests to internal resources automatically tunnel through Major.
    - Use any existing IDE or setups you have locally to develop code with full context into your application stack.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refresh resources as needed">
    Call `major resource manage` whenever you attach or remove databases/APIs. The CLI will autogenerate clients for you to use against those resources
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy with confidence">
    `major app deploy` checks git status, prompts for a commit message if needed, pushes main, then creates a new version and streams deployment status until it’s live.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout icon="sparkles">
Treat apps as your own! You can develop normally in them, use git, etc. We aren't opinionated about how you build your apps.
