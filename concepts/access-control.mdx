Access in Major is opinionated: the **Major App Editor** (launch it with `major app editor`) is the source of truth for who can view, edit, deploy, or consume every application and resource. The CLI simply enforces whatever the editor configures.

## Layers of access

1. **People** – You invite teammates via the editor, add them to organizations, and assign roles such as Viewer, Editor, or Admin.
2. **Applications** – Each app inherits org defaults but can override who may start it locally, push new versions, or edit UI states.
3. **Resources** – Databases, APIs, and queues expose fine-grained scopes (read-only, read/write, admin). When you attach a resource to an app, Major logs that binding and enforces it everywhere.

All of the above is visible in the UI so security reviews stay simple. The CLI never stores long-lived credentials—just short JWTs that represent the access you already granted.

## How the CLI participates

- `major user login` ensures only authenticated engineers can run commands. Tokens live in the OS keychain.
- `major org select` chooses which org’s policies apply to future commands.
- `major resource manage` syncs the latest resource bindings into your repo so you cannot accidentally call an off-limits system.
- `major app deploy` checks your role before it creates a new version; if you lack deploy rights, the API rejects the request before any build runs.

## Workflow tips

- Review access changes in the editor before you run sensitive commands. The CLI surfaces the resulting policies but cannot override them.
- Use groups or teams in the editor to avoid manual role drift.
- When onboarding a teammate, have them run `major user login`, then grant them the appropriate role directly in the editor so their next CLI command already respects it.

<Note>
Need to audit who has access? Head to the App Editor → Access tab. Every deployment started from the CLI links back to the person who ran it.
